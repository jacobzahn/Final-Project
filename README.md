# Final-Project
This Project is a combination of the basic model, the data model, and the FTCS model.

The feature that brings together the FTCS model and the rest is the use of the latitudinal Solar Forcing in the previous code. Specifically, the latitudinal solar forcing was plotted with a single global CO2 values for all latitudes to see how the radiative balance of earth changes with latitude. The results show that CO2 and solar forcing approach the same magnitude as latitude increases.
